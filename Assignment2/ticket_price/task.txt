Imagine the owner of a movie theater who has complete freedom in setting ticket prices. The more he charges, the fewer the people who can afford tickets. In a recent experiment the owner determined a precise relationship between the price of a ticket and average attendance.  At a price of Rs 15.00 per ticket, 120 people attend a performance. Decreasing the price by  5 Rupees increases attendance by 20 and increasing the price by  5 Rupees decreases attendance by 20. Unfortunately, the increased attendance also comes at an increased cost. Every performance costs the owner Rs.500. Each attendee costs another 3 Rupees. The owner would like to know the exact relationship between profit and ticket price so that he can determine the price at which he can make the highest profit. Implement a functional program to find out the best ticket price.
